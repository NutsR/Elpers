First Ever Next JS project
## ElpCamp (Based on YelpCamp)

This was created from scratch and using the main branch as a reference
Started learning Next js from this project itself 

use .env.example for env files 
to start in development mode
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Unoptimized and most likely isn't as clean as i wanted it to be
Currently putting on a halt till i learn more about NextJs and optimizing code and writing it cleaner
Will be learning typescript on the way aswell and more on styling it better
